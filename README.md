## 🚀 What is HW Land?
HW Land is a sophisticated AI village simulation that creates a living, breathing world of NPCs with varying levels of self-awareness. Directly inspired by "The Truman Show," the simulation features a central unaware protagonist surrounded by AI-driven aware citizens, creating unique and complex social dynamics that explore the boundaries between reality and simulation.

### Key Features
- 🧠 **Advanced AI Systems**: Complex personality and behavior patterns with special focus on maintaining the simulation's integrity
- 🤝 **Dynamic Social Interactions**: Realistic relationship dynamics between aware and unaware residents
- 💭 **Memory Systems**: Short and long-term memory with natural decay and scenario consistency
- 🎭 **Protagonist System**: Specialized AI for the unaware central character
- 🎬 **Director Mode**: Control and influence town events to create engaging scenarios

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+
- Cargo package manager
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation
```bash
# Install using cargo
cargo install trumantown

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/sovagpt/trumantown.git
cd trumantown
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage
```rust
use trumantown::Town;

fn main() {
    let mut town = Town::new();
    
    // Initialize the protagonist
    town.create_protagonist();
    
    // Add aware NPCs as town residents
    town.add_aware_resident(ResidentType::Neighbor);
    town.add_aware_resident(ResidentType::Shopkeeper);
    
    town.run();
}
```

## 🧠 AI Systems
- **Protagonist AI**: Special system for the unaware central character
- **Resident AI**: Advanced system for aware NPCs
- **Director System**: Scenario creation and management
- **Memory System**: Consistent experience storage and recall
- **Social System**: Complex relationship dynamics
- **Script System**: Contextual dialogue and scenario management
